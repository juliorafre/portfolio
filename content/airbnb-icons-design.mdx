You've probably seen the latest Airbnb keynote, where they presented updates to their services and a host of other things. However, I'm not here to talk about Airbnb's updates, but rather something that I believe captured the attention of more than a few people: the new icon styles. That's why I spent a few minutes in ChatGPT generating a prompt to create them.

  images={[
    {
      src: '/images/samples/minis/mini-1.png',
      alt: 'Carousel Image 1',
    },
    {
      src: '/images/samples/minis/mini-2.png',
      alt: 'Carousel Image 2',
    },
    {
      src: '/images/samples/minis/mini-3.png',
      alt: 'Carousel Image 3',
    },
    {
      src: '/images/samples/minis/mini-4.png',
      alt: 'Carousel Image 4',
    },
    {
      src: '/images/samples/minis/mini-5.png',
      alt: 'Carousel Image 5',
    },
    {
      src: '/images/samples/minis/mini-6.png',
      alt: 'Carousel Image 6',
    },
    {
      src: '/images/samples/minis/mini-7.png',
      alt: 'Carousel Image 7',
    },
  ]}
/>

Here is the prompt I used to create the images:

<span id="prompt" className="anchor"></span>

<Highlight>
Photograph of a hyper-realistic miniature &lt;element&gt;, crafted with premium detail and realism — set in a clean studio environment with a pure white background, soft diffused lighting, and a gentle natural shadow cast beneath. The model features realistic proportions, subtly rounded edges (if applicable), and surface finishes true to scale (e.g. satin-matte, brushed metal, soft fabric, weathered stone, translucent plastic, etc.). Include high-fidelity micro-textures (e.g. wood grain, foliage, ceramic, skin, glass, etc.), scaled accurately. Shot from a 3/4 perspective at approximately 40–100 cm camera distance using a 50 mm equivalent lens at ƒ/11 for full depth of field. High-resolution output (8K), cropped to a square aspect ratio (1:1). Rendered with photographic fidelity — avoid stylization, cartoonish effects, or toy-like aesthetics.

Negative prompt: exaggerated proportions, toy appearance, cartoon filters, visible text, logos, people, hands, harsh reflections, motion blur.

</Highlight>

Change the <i>&lt;element&gt;</i> to the object you want to create.
